<h1>Assignment 1 - Evaluate a bad design: Parker Lloyd</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For my assignment, I chose to evaluate the design of these elevator buttons. At first glance, it might not seem like anything is wrong, but the design is confusing when you really look at it. It's confusing because it has up and down arrows, but it is unclear whether the correct buttons are next to the arrows, or are being pointed at by the arrows. This violates the principle of the user being able to "reach the goal" quickly, and being usable at first glance. This design could be improved by turning the arrows themselves into buttons, so the users wouldn't be confused and wouldn't have to take more than a split second to evaluate the buttons.&nbsp;</span></p>
