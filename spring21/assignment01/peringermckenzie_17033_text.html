<h1>Assignment 1 - Evaluate a bad design: McKenzie Peringer</h1>
<div style="width: 600px; margin: 20px auto; border: 1px solid #888; padding: 20px;">
  <p><span>Over the last few years of driving vehicles, I have found many issues with the interior interface inconsistencies from vehicle to vehicle. I realized my issue with these designs when I was driving my friend’s 2014 model Ford Escape. I currently have a 2008 model Ford Escape so when driving the car, I thought driving this newer model would be a breeze, I was however proved wrong very quickly. As I started to drive away, there were flashing lights and a loud buzzing noise coming through the speakers warning me that the parking brake was engaged. This wasn’t the first time I’ve driven off in a car with the emergency brake still engaged. </span></p>
<p><span>In many designs of cars, you are often unaware of the fact that your brake is engaged until the loud alarm goes off when you're already halfway down the street. This is the first flaw in the emergency brake design. The second flaw would be the placement of the release lever for the emergency brake. In my 2008 model, there is a lever to the left of my steering wheel to release the brake, so instinctively, I reached down to pull the lever, only to find that I had popped the hood. Both of these vehicles were both Escapes, both from Ford and essentially the same car, so why would they have changed the positioning of the levers? It turns out that they had not only changed the positioning of the hood lever but had removed the brake release entirely. With my friend’s newer model, all you have to do is press on the emergency brake again and the brake is disengaged. </span></p>
<p><span>Ford must have realized the flawed design of my 2008 Escape because of the close proximity of the brake release and hood release and the resemblance they have to each other and changed it in the newer models. I know consumers of Ford are happy with this new design but by making this change, there is a high possibility of user error due to confusion. Now that the issue of both release levers being designed and placed too similarly has been fixed in the newer models of this car, a change in the alerting system to let users know that the emergency brake is enabled before driving off is needed in order to prevent damage the car due to the design of the emergency brake design.&nbsp;</span></p>
