# VTD 4xx/5xx Human Technological Systems Seminar

## Prerequisites



## Course Description

Overview of user interaction design and evaluation of physical and virtual human-machine systems. Topics include introduction to human factors, human technological systems, usability evaluation, HCI in virtual reality, human error, human performance,  mixed-initiative systems (intelligent and autonomous teaming), design and prototyping.

**Recommended Preparation:** Graduate student status (5xx) *or* undergraduate who has taken a VTD 400-Level history and theory course *or* instructor approval

This is an 16-week onine course to introduce Virtual Technology and Design students to human factors, human computer interaction design and evaluation, emphasizing mixed-initiative systems and virtual reality. The first 8-weeks are to develop the theory and during the last 8-weeks students conduct individual projects. 

## Tentative Schedule

### Week 1 - Introduction to Human Factors
What is human factors?
Principles of human factors

**Read:** 

Donald A. Norman (2013). The Design of Everyday Things. Basic Books. Chapter 1. The PsychoPathology of Everyday Things.

### Week 2 - Usability, User Experience

**Read:** 

[Usability Geek. The Difference Between Usability and User Experience.](https://usabilitygeek.com/the-difference-between-usability-and-user-experience/)

[NN/g. 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

[NN/g. 10 UX Research Cheat Sheet](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-research-cheat-sheet/)


Assignment 1: Evaluate a bad design. What is it? Why is it bad? What human factors or usability principles does it violate? How could it be improved?

### Week 3 - Human error and human reliability

Clayton M. Christensen, Michael E. Raynor, and Rory McDonald (2015). [What Is Disruptive Innovation? Harvard Business Review]
(https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation)

**Assignment 2:** Identify and describe a human technology system that could benefit from innovative disruption or is undergoing innovative disruption. Describe challenges faced by the innovative disruption and how you could help to solve those challenges. 

### Week 5 - Human Performance and Evaluation
 - Primary task performance
   - accuracy
   - time
 - Human Errors (commission, omission, sequence, timing, error rates)
 - Physiological measures
   - eye tracking
   - skin conductance
   - EEG 
 - Subjective
   - Workload
   - Situational Awareness

### Week 6 - Design and prototyping

**Assignment 3:** Explore a new (to you) design or prototyping tool and document your experience using the tool. What is it? What does it do? What did you do with it? Did you find it worthwhile?

### Week 7 -  Virtual Reality

Best practices

Read: Oculus Developer. https://developer.oculus.com/learn/

### Week 8 - mixed-initiative systems
