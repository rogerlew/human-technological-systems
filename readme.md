## Course Description

Overview of user interaction design and evaluation of physical and virtual human-machine systems. We want to train the next generation of virtual integrated designers!

VTD is inherently interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary. We utilize knowledge and methods from various domains to:

-   Understand the role of humans in highly sophisticated human-coupled systems
-   Apply systems-thinking and first-principles to design solutions
-   Model, simulate, and iterate to optimize designs
-   Develop, deploy, and validate virtual technologies
    
Topics include introduction to human factors, human technological systems, usability evaluation, HCI in virtual reality, human error, human performance, mixed-initiative systems (intelligent and autonomous teaming), design and prototyping.

**Recommended Preparation:** Graduate student status (5xx) *or* undergraduate who has taken a VTD 300-Level production course and one VTD 400-Level history and theory course, or with instructor approval.

This is an 16-week onine course to introduce Virtual Technology and Design students to human factors, human computer interaction design and evaluation, emphasizing mixed-initiative systems and virtual reality. The first 8-weeks are to develop the theory and during the last 8-weeks students lead and conduct individual projects related to the course content. 


## About This Course

- This is a seminar course. Active participation is required. The idea is to not only familiarize students with the topics but to get students to relate to the topics.

- The first weeks will cover AI (to support AI assisted learning) and provide background regarding Human Factors/ Cognitive Psychology/ Sensation and Perception/ Usability & User Experience. The content and discussion is oriented towards designers, engineers, and technologists.
  
- After that we explore contemporary technology topics that the students find relevent and the instructor deems interesting. This could include: self-driving cars, human enhancement/post humanism, AI art, etc. The intent to get to an academic level of discussion supported by papers and other in-depth materials. We generally paln a few weeks ahead and bounce around from topic to topic.

- The last 8 weeks is oriented towards a "MiniProject" where students develop a human technological system

# Assignments

## Assignment 1 (due 3/9)

Evaluate a bad design. The design should be a product. It could be digital, physical, or both. Be sure to evaluate a product and not just a design choice or feature of the product. What is it? Why is it bad? What human factors or usability principles does it violate? (Please provide a citation for the principle, e.g. one of NN/g Usability Heuristics). How could it be improved? Please include a descriptive title.

(Looking for quality over quantity. Photos, diagrams, animations are welcome. The tone should be professional but doesn't necessarily need to be academic.)

### Assignment 2

**Read:** [Paul Graham - Hackers and Painters](http://www.paulgraham.com/hp.html)
     
Use ChatGPT and/or other GAN (GPT3, Bard, Dall-E2) to create or explore something. Produce a short presentation on the experience or the product that you made. Include some tips or description of your interaction (the method). 

Presentatations live in class.


## Miniproject ()

Students develop independent miniprojects related to human technological systems or human machine interfaces. Students will submit weekly status reports and meet with the instructor as needed. The miniprojects will culminate in a written report and a 8-10 minute oral.
    
    
  - The topic and the employed methods are largely up-to-you (I will provide feedback along the way).
  - The goal is to learn through experience and document the process
  - example topics
    - conceptual exploration of a future with humanoid robots with strong AI
    - prototyping of a novel interaction for Virtual Reality
    - Development of an AR application
    - prototype of an automation technology
  - Write short progress reports to tell me about your project
  - Hang-out sessions Tuesdays and Thursdays to talk one-on-one or as a group about your project. (Or just hangout and/or work.)
  - Short final presentation during finals week
    
#### Status Reports
    
Document where you are at with your project. Status reports are due:    

The Final report is due Monday, May 9 of Final's week.
### Week 9 – 10 Project Identification

Identify a problem space and the goal or intent of your mini project. Conduct and summarize research to describe the problem space, prior art (alternatives, similiar products) and how your project fits in.

### Week 11 Mini project Method

Create a plan for carrying out your project. What tools or techniques will you use? Do you have experience with those tools and techniques? What challenges might you face, how will you mitigate those challenges?

### Week 12 – 14 Production

Carryout your project while documenting your findings along the way

### Week 15 – 16 Analysis and Dissemination

Organize your findings and document them in a written report. The report should describe the following: 
    
- Introduction
    - the problem, alternative solutions, your goals
- Method
    - what are you doing to examine the problem or prototype a solution
- Analysis/assessment
    - how successful was your approach/process/work. Could include user testing or not. 
      Could just be a self-assessment of how the project went
- Conclusions and discussion
    
Pictures would be nice. Probably should be 5-10 pages. Could be in a manuscript format (e.g. APA Style) 
or could more graphical PDF/marketing styled document.
    
Prepare a 8-10 minute presentation on your project during the timeslot for our Final.

# Grading

Participation/Attendance     30%

Assignments 30% (15% per assignment)

Mini-project and presentation 40% (10% status reports, 20% project report, 10% presentation)


# General Expectations and Information

## Preparation and Participation

This is a seminar course. You are expected to read the assigned materials before class, and be prepared to discuss the information during class. Your constructive and informed participation is essential. Please make sure that you also follow the basic rules of civility and respect during the discussions.

## Attendance and Preparedness for Class

Regular class attendance and participation is expected in this class. For a seminar like this your attendance should be 100%. Please let me know in advance when you will miss a class for any reason. More than one absence will lead to a reduction of your participation grade.

Given that this is a seminar style class it is expected that the core materials have been read prior to class and that you have thought about the material in a meaningful way. Preparedness factors into the attendance / participation grade.

## Respect other Students

There might be times where you are asked to comment on other students work or just engage in a discussion with each other (sometimes in small groups).  Please be respectful when interacting with each other - that doesn't mean that you have to agree with the other's view. Please also try to be professional in the way you express your opinions and avoid expletives or otherwise offensive language.  I have posted the university approved Civility Clause below, but all of you probably know what it means to be respectful of each other.

## Civility Clause

In any environment in which people interact in meaningful ways to gain knowledge, it is essential that each member feel as free and safe as possible in their participation. To this end, it will be course policy and expected that everyone will be treated with mutual respect. We certainly do not have to agree, but everyone deserves to feel they are heard. We learn by engaging in constructive evidence‐based dialogue. Therefore we shall establish in this course a general understanding that members of this class (including students, instructors, professors, and teaching assistants) will be respected and respectful to one another in discussion, in action, in teaching, and in learning.

## AI Clause

Use of AI is permitted and perhaps even encouraged. However the users of AI are ultimately responsible for the work. So if you use AI do so responsibly and please disclose AI assisted content.

## Other Potentially Disruptive Classroom Behavior

Behaviors that disrupt other students’ learning are not acceptable (e.g., arriving consistently late for class; cell phone use; texting; reading non-course related materials; extensive social conversations during class), and will be addressed by the instructor. I do this because I know that some students are easily distracted, and I want to support them and make sure their learning experience is positive.

## Class Policy on Cell Phones & Laptops

Cell phones should be turned off and put away during the entire class period. If you have a situation in which you must have your phone out (e.g., a family emergency), please try to limit its use. 

## Appropriate Communication

Please try to be somewhat professional in your coorespondances. You can address me as "Roger" in person and in written coorespondances.

### Submitting your assignments

Unless otherwise instructed, please submit your assignments through Canvas. I will post each assignment in Canvas and you can upload your file(s) into the assignment or copy and paste the text into the appropriate box. If you notice that there is no assignment in Canvas that matches what you have to submit, please let me know asap so I can make it visible to the class. This will allow me to track your assignments much better than if you sent them through email, and it also allows me to post comments together with your grade. If you are in doubt whether bblearn has accepted your assignment, you can always email an additional copy.

## Learning Outcomes

This course focuses on three of the University of Idaho's main learning outcome that are related to your knowledgeable application of human factors methods to real-world issues, communicate the process and the expected results, and do so in an ethical and responsible way.   

1.	Think and create - Use multiple strategies to examine real-world issues, explore creative avenues of expression, solve problems, and make consequential decisions.
2.	Communicate - Acquire, articulate, create and convey intended meaning using verbal and non-verbal methods of communication that demonstrate respect and understanding in a complex society.
3.	Practice citizenship - Apply principles of ethical leadership, collaborative engagement, socially responsible behavior, respect for diversity in an interdependent world, and a service-oriented commitment to advance and sustain local and global communities.

## Center for Disability Access and Resources

Reasonable accommodations are available for students who have documented temporary or permanent disabilities. All accommodations must be approved through the Center for Disability Access and Resources located in the Bruce M. Pitman Center, Suite 127 in order to notify your instructor as soon as possible regarding accommodation(s) needed for the course. Contact DSS at 208-885-6307, email cdar@uidaho.edu or go to www.uidaho.edu/current-students/cdar.

# Academic Dishonesty and Plagiarism 

(Ironically this is borrowed from Dr. Werner. Thanks Steffen)

In general there haven’t been many instances of academic dishonesty in our graduate courses. I am including this just so that everyone knows the expectations and there is no ambiguity what is expected of you. 

Academic dishonesty includes cheating, falsification, fabrication, multiple submission, plagiarism, abuse of academic materials, complicity, or misconduct in research. The following are brief descriptions of a short list of instances of academic dishonesty. 
- Cheating is the intentional use of, or attempt to use, unauthorized material, information, or study aids in any academic activity to gain advantage.
- Multiple Submission includes, but is not limited to, submitting the same paper or oral report for credit in two different courses. If you take the same course again (maybe you withdrew from it before) then you can reuse your papers or assignments, of course. For example, if you are working on a research project in a lab for research credits and then use the result of that research (the report) as the main project for this class, that would be an example of academic dishonesty due to multiple submission.
- Plagiarism is representing the work of another as one’s own without proper acknowledgment of the source. Make sure that you clearly identify which parts of a project you were responsible for, and which parts of a project others worked on.
- Complicity. A student is guilty of complicity in academic dishonesty if he or she intentionally or knowingly helps or attempts to help another or others to commit an act of academic dishonesty.

One of the biggest potential problems that you as a student face in your writing is the issue of plagiarism. In short, plagiarism means that you are either passing off someone else’s work as your own (either intentionally or because you don’t know how to adequately distinguish your own work from someone else’s) or that you are relying too much on other people’s work without contributing significantly yourself. There are a few quick checks that you can do to avoid plagiarism:

1.	Are you using someone else’s words in your writing? If you do so you have to put that part in quotation marks and clearly cite the source.  This makes it clear to anyone that these words are not your own and the reader can find the original source.
2.	Are you relying on someone else’s ideas without using exactly their words? Maybe you are paraphrasing someone else’s work – in that case you still have to cite the other person’s work and give credit where credit is due.  Paraphrasing does get rid of the quotation marks but does not mean that you don’t have to identify that passage as substantially someone else’s work.
3.	Have you contributed significantly to your writing? Even if you cite all of your sources you might still fall short of owning your writing if all you have done is create a patchwork of other peoples’ work. For example, if you are answering a question on an exam where you are asked to define a particular term, you cannot just copy and paste the definition from an online source and then cite it – that doesn’t make it your own work.

Plagiarism is a serious issue and you cannot claim ignorance of the rules to protect yourself. If we encounter plagiarized work in your assignment (or exams) we are forced to fail you for that particular assignment (or part of the exam), or fail you for the entire course. That is obviously not in anyone’s interest – so please make sure that you fully understand the rules regarding plagiarism and if you have any questions please ask me before you submit your work.
