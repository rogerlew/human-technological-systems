VTD 4xx Human Technological Systems Seminar
Overview of user interaction design and evaluation of physical and virtual human-machine systems. Topics include introduction to human factors, human technological systems, usability evaluation, HCI in virtual reality, human error, human performance,  mixed-initiative systems (intelligent and autonomous teaming), design and prototyping.

Recommended Preparation: ???

This is an 8-week seminar course to introduce Virtual Technology and Design students to human factors, human computer interaction design and evaluation, emphasizing mixed-initiative systems and virtual reality.

Week 1 - Introduction to Human Factors
What is human factors?
Principles of human factors

Read: Donald A. Norman (2013). The Design of Everyday Things. Basic Books. Chapter 1. The PsychoPathology of Everyday Things.

Week 2 - Usability, User Experience

https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-research-cheat-sheet/

Assignment: Evaluate a bad design. What is it? Why is it bad? What human factors or usability principles does it violate? How could it be improved?

Week 3 - Human error and human reliability

Read: Reason, James (1980). Human error: models and management. BMJ 2000 (320), 768-770.

Week 4 - Human Technological Systems and Innovative Disruption

Read: Kim Vincente. (2004). The Human Factor. Chapter 2. Why is Technology So Out Of Control? Walking Around Half-Blind.
y Clayton M. Christensen, Michael E. Raynor, and Rory McDonald (2015). What Is Disruptive Innovation? Harvard Business Review
https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation

Assignment: Identify and describe a human technology system that could benefit from innovative disruption or is undergoing innovative disruption. Describe challenges faced by the innovative disruption and how you could help to solve those challenges. 

Week 5 - Human Performance and Evaluation
Primary task performance (accuracy, time)
Human Errors (commission, omission, sequence, timing, error rates)
Physiological measures
Subjective
Workload
Situational Awareness

Week 6 - Design and prototyping

Assignment: Explore a new (to you) design or prototyping tool and document your experience using the tool. What is it? What does it do? What did you do with it? Did you find it worthwhile?

Week 7 -  Virtual Reality
Best practices
Read: How digital technologies are transforming aerospace and defense. https://developer.oculus.com/learn/

Week 8 - mixed-initiative systems

Read: https://www.ey.com/en_gl/aerospace-defense/how-digital-technologies-are-transforming-aerospace-and-defense

Assignment: Create a design concept for a mixed-initiative system. What is it? What does it do? How is it better than current alternatives?
