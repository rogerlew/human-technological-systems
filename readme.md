## Course Description

Overview of user interaction design and evaluation of physical and virtual human-machine systems. We want to train the next generation of virtual integrated designers!

VTD is inherently interdisciplinary/transdisciplinary. We utilize knowledge and methods from various domains to:

-   Understand the role of humans in highly sophisticated human-coupled systems
-   Apply systems-thinking and first-principles to design solutions
-   Model, simulate, and iterate to optimize designs
-   Develop, deploy, and validate virtual technologies
    
Topics include introduction to human factors, human technological systems, usability evaluation, HCI in virtual reality, human error, human performance,  mixed-initiative systems (intelligent and autonomous teaming), design and prototyping.

**Recommended Preparation:** Graduate student status (5xx) *or* undergraduate who has taken a VTD 300-Level production course and one VTD 400-Level history and theory course, or with instructor approval.


This is an 16-week onine course to introduce Virtual Technology and Design students to human factors, human computer interaction design and evaluation, emphasizing mixed-initiative systems and virtual reality. The first 8-weeks are to develop the theory and during the last 8-weeks students lead and conduct individual projects related to the course content. 

## Tentative Schedule

### Week 0 - Introduction to the Course, Introduction to Human Factors (1/13)

Introductions
Course Description, Goals, Expecations

### Week 1 - Introduction to Human Factors (1/18)

What is human factors?
Principles of human factors

**Read:** 

[Donald A. Norman (2013). The Design of Everyday Things. Basic Books. Chapter 1. The PsychoPathology of Everyday Things.](https://github.com/rogerlew/human-technological-systems/raw/main/readings/NormanD_DesignOfEverydayThings_Chapter1.pdf)

### Week 2 - Usability, User Experience (1/20, 1/25)

**Read:** 

[Usability Geek. The Difference Between Usability and User Experience.](https://usabilitygeek.com/the-difference-between-usability-and-user-experience/)

[NN/g. 10 Usability Heuristics](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ten-usability-heuristics/)

[NN/g. 10 UX Research Cheat Sheet](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/ux-research-cheat-sheet/)


Assignment 1 (due 1/25): Evaluate a bad design. What is it? Why is it bad? What human factors or usability principles does it violate? How could it be improved? 

(Looking for quality over quantity. Photos, diagrams, animations are welcome. The tone should be professional but doesn't necessarily need to be academic.)


### Week 3 - Human error and human reliability (1/27, 2/1)

**Read:** 

[Reason, James (1980). Human error: models and management. BMJ 2000 (320), 768-770.](https://github.com/rogerlew/human-technological-systems/raw/main/readings/Reason2000.pdf)

### Week 4 - Human Technological Systems and Innovative Disruption (2/3, 2/8)

**Read:** 

[Kim Vincente. (2004). The Human Factor. Chapter 2. Why is Technology So Out Of Control? Walking Around Half-Blind.](https://github.com/rogerlew/human-technological-systems/raw/main/readings/Kim_Vicente_The_Human_Factor.pdf)

Clayton M. Christensen, Michael E. Raynor, and Rory McDonald (2015). [What Is Disruptive Innovation? Harvard Business Review]
(https://hbr.org/2015/12/what-is-disruptive-innovation)

**Assignment 2:** Identify and describe a human technology system that could benefit from innovative disruption or is undergoing innovative disruption. Describe challenges faced by the innovative disruption and how you could help to solve those challenges. 

### Week 5 - Design, Science, Engineering (2/10, 2/15)

How are design, science, and engineering different? or the same? Are Design Thinking, First Principles Design, Design Science, Design Process, Engineering Design substantive concepts worthy of study or just Buzzwords. The goal of this week is to explore these topics and for you to articulate informed opinions about the topic and your approach as a designer/engineer/scientist/analyst/<blank>.
    
**Assignment 3:** Describe your approach to problem solving and conceptualizing a design solution. How did you acquire or evolve this approach? What are the strengths of your approach or how is your approach tailored to your strengths. What are the weakness of your approach, how might you mitigate them in the future.

### Week 6 - Design and prototyping (Maker week) (2/17, 2/22)

**Assignment 4:** Make a physical or virtual prototype of something that makes your life easier, faster, better, or more entertaining. Document what you made and what you would do differently. Bonus points for using and documenting a process or technique that is new to you.

This week is more about "the making" and less about the originality of what you are making. 

### Week 7 -  Virtual Reality, Metaverse, Blockchain (2/24, 3/1)

Best practices

**Read:** 

Miller, Randall (April 2019). [How digital technologies are transforming aerospace and defense.](https://www.ey.com/en_gl/aerospace-defense/how-digital-technologies-are-transforming-aerospace-and-defense) ey.com. 

**Assignment 5:** "Sketch" a design concept for a mixed-initiative system. What is it? What does it do? How is it better than current alternatives?


### Week 9 - 15 - Miniproject

Students develop independent miniprojects related to human technological systems or human machine interfaces. Students will submit weekly status reports and meet with the instructor as needed. The miniprojects will culminate in a written report and a 8-10 minute oral

### Week 9 – 10 Project Identification (Spring Break, 3/24)

Identify a problem space and the goal or intent of your mini project. 

### Week 11 Mini project Method (3/31)

Create a plan for carrying out your project

### Week 12 – 14 Production (4/7, 4/14, 4/21)

Carryout your project while documenting your findings along the way

### Week 15 – 16 Analysis and Dissemination (4/28, 5/5)

Organize your findings and document them in a report. Prepare a 8-10 minute presentation on your project.
